# Metrics (intro)
In this directory tips & tricks for improving measurement mechanics into your organization.

There's a Dutch saying called 'Meten is weten'. It basically implies if you measure something, you are able to understand it better. Sounds easy right? It's not. Folks find it really difficult to actually come up with something tangible. This was the main reason for me  to publish any relevant content I produced or found online. This way, we can all participate in improving measurement.

# CTI Metrics
May 2019, I published a little cheatsheet to be used for measuring Cyber Threat Intelligence. Per Jan 2020, i've moved this the details to this repo to make it easier for me to update the set.

Target audiences:
- Strategic; Executive teams, C-level, CISO, business reps
- Tactical ; SOC managers, Information security officers, business reps
- Operational; Security analysts, CTI analysis, Incident responders, business reps

Important personal considerations:
- Mature CTI metrics are correlated with business goals, outcomes and enablement. You measure on performance & effectiveness.
- Measurement is only possible by clear alignment with audience & stakeholder(s); understanding what they need and define PIRs (Priority intelligence requirement) accordingly. PIRs guide improvement of metrics, and supporting technology required. 
- When organizations reach intermediate phase, KPIs generally continuously become reviewed, refined and defined. In essence is this done by (re)defining PIRs for each stage of the clients specific intelligence cycle and governing it through an dedicated intelligence program.
- Higher vs lesser value is based on stakeholder & community feedback, qualitative review of existing metrics and quantitative tracking through a maturity model (not public ÔÅå).
