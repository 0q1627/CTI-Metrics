# Intro
In this directory tips & tricks for improving measurement mechanics into your organization.

There's a Dutch saying called 'Meten is weten'. It basically implies if you measure something, you are able to understand it better. Sounds easy right? It's not. Folks find it really difficult to actually come up with something tangible. This was the main reason for me  to publish any relevant content I produced or found online. This way, we can all participate in improving measurement.

# Measuring your CTI program 
May 2019, I published this cheatsheet to be used for measuring Cyber Threat Intelligence. I was inspired by a talk by  [@MarSChauvin & @t_gidwani on CTI metrics](https://www.first.org/resources/papers/london2019/1130-How-to-Get-Promoted-Gidwani.pdf). From that moment on, I keep anything related to measurement & CTI in a central Excel document. Per Jan 2020, I've moved  details to this repo to make it easier for me to update the set and for you to plug/contribute the latest details. The latest update to the doc is from Jan 2024. 

Most notable is that the metrics have not changed that much over the years. How we combine them together to tell a story did. Ration if you will. How this impacts your organization in practice is something you have to understand within the context of your own organization. A key adjustment based over time related to teams reporting on effectiveness and trends versus pure, factual, numbers.

Target audience division when concerned about CTI metrics:
- Strategic; Executive teams, C-level, CISO, business reps
- Tactical ; SOC managers, Information security officers, business reps
- Operational; Security analysts, CTI analysis, Incident responders, business reps

Few personal considerations:
- I believe mature CTI metrics are correlated with business goals, outcomes and enablement. You measure on performance & effectiveness. The most valuable is measuring effectiveness, the least valuable is performance.
- Measurement is only possible by clear alignment with audience & stakeholder(s); understanding what they need and define PIRs (Priority intelligence requirement) accordingly. PIRs guide improvement of metrics, and supporting technology required. This also dictates the reporting format.
- When organizations reach intermediate phase, KPIs (or KCI's) generally continuously become reviewed, refined and defined. In essence is this done by (re)defining PIRs for each stage of the clients specific intelligence cycle and governing it through an dedicated intelligence program.
- Higher vs lesser value is based on stakeholder & community feedback, qualitative review of existing metrics and quantitative tracking through a maturity model: https://www.crest-approved.org/buying-building-cyber-services/cyber-threat-intelligence-maturity-assessment-tools/.
